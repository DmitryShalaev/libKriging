# Installation

## Requirements
* CMake â‰¥ 3.11
* C++ Compiler with C++11 support;
  
  Tested with:
     
  |   Compiler/OS    | Linux        | MacOS                    | Windows       |
  |:----------------:|:-------------|:-------------------------|:--------------|
  |       GCC        | **5.4**, 8.3 |                          |               |
  |      Clang       | 7.1          | AppleClang **9.1**, 10.0 |               |
  | MS Visual Studio |              |                          | **15 (2017)** |
  
  (bold values represent configurations used in Travis CI pipelines)
  
* [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) is required for test coverage (with `genhtml` for pretty test coverage html reporting) 

## Compilation and unit tests

### Preamble

We assume that:
  * [libKriging](https://github.com/MASCOTNUM/libKriging.git) code is available locally in directory *`${LIBKRIGING}`*  
  * you have built a fresh new directory *`${BUILD}`*
  * following commands are executed in *`${BUILD}`* directory 
  
PS: *`$NAME`* represents an absolute path of your choice

 Select your compilation *`${MODE}`* between: 
  * `Release` : produce an optimized code
  * `Debug` (default) : produce a debug code
  * `Coverage` : for code coverage analysis (not yet tested with Windows)

### Compilation for Linux and MacOS
  * Configure
  ```shell
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=${MODE} ${LIBKRIGING}
  ```
  * Build
  ```shell
  cmake --build .
  # aka with classical makefiles
  make  
  ```
  * Run tests
  ```shell
  ctest
  # aka with classical makefiles
  make test  
  ```
  
  * if you have selected `Coverage` mode, you can generate code coverage analysis over all tests using
  ```shell
  cmake --build . --target coverage --config Coverage
  # aka with classical makefiles
  make coverage
   ```
  or 
  ```shell
  cmake --build . --target coverage-report --config Coverage
  # aka with classical makefiles
  make coverage-report
   ```
  to produce an html report located in `${BUILD}/coverage/index.html`
   
### Compilation for Windows
  * Configure
  ```shell
  cmake ${LIBKRIGING}
  ```
  * Build
  ```shell
  cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config ${MODE}
  ```
  * Run tests
  ```shell
  export PATH=${BUILD}/src/lib/${MODE}:$PATH
  ctest -C ${MODE}
  ```
   
### Deployment

To deploy libKriging as an installed library, you have to add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX}` option to 
first `cmake` configuration command.

If `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable is not set with CMake, default installation directoty is `{BUILD}/installed`.

# For Linux and MacOS

e.g.:
```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=${MODE} -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX} ${LIBKRIGING}
```
and then 
```shell
cmake --build . --target install
# aka with classical makefiles
make install
```

# For Windows

e.g.:
```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX} ${LIBKRIGING} 
```
and then 
```shell
cmake --build . --target install --config ${MODE}
```
