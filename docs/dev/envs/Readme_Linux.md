# Linux minimal setup

for a debian or ubuntu 20 Linux distributions, required packages are
```
apt install -y build-essential g++ cmake git python3 python3-pip octave liboctave-dev r-base liblapack-dev gfortran
```

To configure a fresh new ubuntu:20.04, you can use the script [`ubuntu20/install.sh`](../ubuntu20/install.sh); it will set up all what you need.

You should also read the related [README](ubuntu20/README.md) for more details.
